# Solarized without the bullshit, redux.

Inspired by [flattened_dark.vim](https://github.com/romainl/flattened).

## Usage

This theme will render Solarized Dark or Light depending on the `background`
setting.

It also doesn't set `termguicolors`, and will fall back to using terminal
colors if it is off. In such case ensure your terminal is configured with
Solarized colors.

## Screenshots

It's Solarized, what do you want?
